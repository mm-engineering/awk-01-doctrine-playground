# As We Know, Episode 01: I Want To Speak To The EntityManager

_Doctrine EntityManager Tips And Tricks_

This basic Symfony-based project is the playground for exploring various ways of interacting with [Doctrine](https://symfony.com/doc/current/doctrine.html)’s [`EntityManager`](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/2.8/tutorials/getting-started.html#obtaining-the-entitymanager).

## Prerequisites

1. Docker (e.g., Docker Desktop), accessible from a shell (e.g., `bash`).

We will run everything in containers, so there is no need to install anything else.

## Workshop Steps

### Install Playground

1. Clone this repository, e.g., `git clone https://github.com/mm-engineering/awk-01-doctrine-playground.git workshop`.
2. Go into the cloned directory, e.g., `cd workshop`.
3. Run `docker run --rm --interactive --tty --volume $PWD:/app composer install` to pull all dependencies.
4. Run `docker-compose build --no-cache --pull` to assemble the containers from scratch.
5. Run `docker-compose up -d` to launch the containers in the background.

### Create Doctrine entities to play with

Let’s create a handy shell alias for the following section:

```shell
# Execute bin/console in docker-compose service named 'php' in current directory
alias dconsole='docker-compose exec php bin/console'
```

1. Create a couple of entities:
   1. Run `dconsole make:entity`. Name it `Warehouse`. No fields for now.
   2. Run `dconsole make:entity`. Name it `Item`. No fields for now.
2. Modify them and create a relationship:
   1. Run `dconsole make:entity`. Use the name `Warehouse` again to modify it:
      1. Add field `name`. Type `string`. Length `64`. Not nullable.
      2. Add field `items`. Type `OneToMany`. Related to class `Item`. Inverse field named `warehouse`, not nullable, orphan removal enabled.
   2. Run `dconsole make:entity`. Use the name `Item` again to modify it:
      1. Add field `name`. Type `string`. Length `255`. Not nullable.
      2. Add field `description`. Type `string`. Length `1024`. Nullable.
3. Generate an appropriate migration with `dconsole make:migration`.
4. Apply said migration with `dconsole doctrine:migration:migrate`.
5. Commit all changes.

Review points:

- Check out the code generated by the Symfony [Maker bundle](https://symfony.com/bundles/SymfonyMakerBundle/current/index.html).
- Also, feel free to connect to the PostgreSQL instance at `localhost:50443/app` and check out the tables that were automatically created.
